# Battleship Game
This project is a partial implementation of the [TreeHouse JavaScript Unit Testing Course](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/javascript-unit-testing).  
I started it to learn about [BDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development) with [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) and [Chai](http://chaijs.com/) and then also took the opportunity to learn how to setup [TravisCI](https://travis-ci.org/) for this repository.
